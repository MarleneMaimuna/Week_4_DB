I created SQL queries to practice and demonstrate the use of aggregation functions such as SUM, AVG, and MAX. I grouped data using GROUP BY, organized results with ORDER BY, and limited outputs with LIMIT. I also added comments to each query to explain its purpose and make the logic clear. These queries calculate totals, averages, and maximum values for the relevant tables, helping me understand how to analyze and summarize data efficiently.
